# Smart-Mirror-Project
As a learning experience, I've been developing a smart-mirror python program for a raspberri pi setup. It uses free APIs to get info to display on a smart-mirror hardware build. 

Notice in the 'icons' folder I have duplicate icons in different file formats. For whatever reason, PIL was not working for me so I could not use the ImageTk module to get PNG files to work, so to get around that I simply reformated my PNG icons to GIF files and it works just fine without importing from the PIL library. 

I intend to outfit another API here, feel free to comment on what kinds of information might be useful on a day-to-day smart mirror. I'm thinking either news or an animated .gif of carlton doing his dance on the bottom corner.
